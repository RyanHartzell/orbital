# orbital
Simple hacky project for viewing CesiumJS+HTML document in a Streamlit app

Project includes:

- Basic Streamlit template app (might register as a streamlit plugin at some point or something...
- Formatting functions for injecting CZML json object into the HTML (either streaming or static)
- Basic helpers for loading TLE data or explicitly defined orbital element files using Python

Goal is for this to be a "bare minimum" interactive CZML formatter and viewer using a Python backend.
